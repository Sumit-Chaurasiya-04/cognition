# Product Roadmap

## Year 1: Foundation & Reliability
* **Feature:** Add support for Word Docs (.docx) and PowerPoint (.pptx).
* **Feature:** "Chat Mode". Integrate a small local LLM (like TinyLlama or Phi-2) via `llama.cpp` to summarize the search results.
* **UX:** Allow users to delete specific files from the UI (currently only "Clear All").

## Year 3: Advanced Intelligence
* **AI:** Auto-classification. When a file is uploaded, AI suggests tags based on content (e.g., "Financial", "Personal", "Code").
* **Platform:** Package as a standalone `.exe` or `.dmg` desktop app using Electron or PyInstaller so no command line is needed.
* **Connectors:** Pull data from Google Drive or Notion APIs (optional, user-configured).

## Year 5-10: The "Second Brain" Ecosystem
* **Integration:** Browser extension to "Clip to Cognition" directly from the web.
* **Mobile:** Companion app for capturing notes on the go.
* **Privacy:** Homomorphic encryption (search data while it remains encrypted).
